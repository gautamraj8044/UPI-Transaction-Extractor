# UPI-Transaction-Extractor
A Python-based tool that uses OCR to extract and parse transaction details from UPI payment screenshots. It preprocesses images, extracts text using PaddleOCR, and identifies key details like amount, date, time, UPI ID, sender, and recipient. The extracted data is structured and saved as a JSON file for easy access and record-keeping.
